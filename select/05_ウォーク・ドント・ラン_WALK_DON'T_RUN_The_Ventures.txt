Wind and storm (wah-ooh)
Gone's the sun (wah-ooh)
From the stars (wah-ooh)
My dark has come
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa, tragedy

Oh, come back (come back)
Have me here (right here)
Hold me love (my love)
Be sincere
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa, tragedy

Like smoke (like smoke) from a fire (from a fire)
Our love (of love) whoa oh oh whoa
Our dreams (our dreams) have all gone (all gone)
Above (above) whoa oh oh whoa

Blown (blown by wind)
Kissed by the snow
All that's left is the dark be-ee (below)
You've gone from me, whoa, whoa, tragedy
Whoa, whoa, whoa tragedy.

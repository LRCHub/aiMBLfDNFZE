Breaking my back until I can't even stand
I'm working my hands until my callouses bled again
I'm breaking my back for a little bit

Run for your life
Passing the enemy
Run for your life
And its apart of me
Run for your life
Color humanity
Programmed inside of me
Freedom denied
Run for your life

Run for your life

Consequences of living in a lie

Now the storm begins. It's been brewing from within
The seeds of revolution's been sown
The time is now, our hearts have turned to stone
The fire that's rising will burn to the bone
The gathering of arms, we're tearing down the wall
Storming the gates to our freedom
The rule of the depraved is coming to an end
The signal that's telling the world, revolution it is coming
It is coming

The time has come
We've had enough we won't take anymore
You see us move in synchronicity
The noble blood will color the streets
We run amok, we'll take the crown and we'll burn it down
The world is here to testify, freedoms calling.
We break the gates, take their heads, we run amok

We run amok

Crimson clouds roll in, a storm of hell awaits
Blood will fall like rain over the southern lands
The flame burns on black smoke rises again
Foretelling the future we fight to defend
The course of history will be written here today
Liberty waits for no tomorrow
Banners of unity held proudly in the air
The rule of corruption will end
Revolution it is coming. It is coming

The time has come
We've had enough we won't take anymore
You see us move in synchronicity
The noble blood will color the streets
We run amok, we'll take the crown and we'll burn it down
The world is here to testify, freedoms calling.
We break the gates, take their heads, we run amok
